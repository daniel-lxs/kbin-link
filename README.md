# Kbin Linker Extension

Find it annoying to copy paste `!memes@beehaw.org` to look at a Lemmy community? This extension is for you.

This extension looks for Lemmy style communities and replaces them to direct you to seeing that community on your kbin instance.

This extension is forked from https://github.com/masrly/mastodon-link, I just made small changes.
